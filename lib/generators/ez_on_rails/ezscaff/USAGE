Description:
    Scaffold generator for creating the mvc-template like standard-scaffolds, but using
    some shared abstract partials for rendering. Hence, changing the partials behavior will
    effect the whole project having minimalized overhead. The syntax of usage is the same like
    the standard scaffold generator of rails.

Usage:
    rails generate ezscaff NAME [FIELD_NAME:FIELD_TYPE]

Example:
    rails generate ezscaff Thing field1:string field2:integer

    This will create:
        scaffold files of standard scaffold generator + if not exists:
        view/shared/_edit.html.erb
        view/shared/_form.html.erb
        view/shared/_new.html.erb
        view/shared/_show.html.erb
        view/shared/_table.html.erb
